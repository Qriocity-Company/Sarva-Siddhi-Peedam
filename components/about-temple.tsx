The Rishis, Angras and Prathyangaras, have shared Sri Maha Pratyangira Devi’s powerful mantra: “Om Sam Pakshak Jwala Jigwe Karala Thamstre Prathyangere Sham Hreem Hum pat”",
            "Pratyangira worship is only done by the guidance of a Guru who is proficient in Tantra and Mantra. Worships dedicated to Pratyangira are performed for the welfare of the people and for eliminating the influences of evil forces. Here at Dharapuram, Sri Pratyangira Devi Velvi Peedam, Pratyangira Homam is performed by her child Swami Sarvanandhar on the days of Amavasya and Poornima."

The Beeja Mantra chanting of “Aim Kleem Saum, Saum Kleem Aim” provides the seeker a calm and steady mind to face any adversities. Those who worship Bala Thripurasundari will achieve purity in the soul."
